# scout.
scout. is a platform designed to help promoter reps and tour managers alike, in smoothing out pain points in the advancement process for Concerts, Festivals, and Live Entertainment productions.

# inspiration.
spanning across five years spent in Event Production for Touring / Concerts, Festivals, and major Sporting Events — working on and with a number of high-visibility events and groups including the Kansas City Chiefs, the NFL, Superbowl LIV, the PGA, AEG Live, Lollapalooza, South by Southwest, and others — it became clear to me that there was a problem with the advancement process for live performances and events. it is often overlooked by outsiders just how much attention to detail and coordination goes on in these instances.

# use case.

let's look at a major arena-tour build for *Muse* from their 2012, 2nd Law Arena Tour.

pretty sweet, right? Now look at this time-lapse of the crew building it over the entire course of a day.

it becomes very clear, very quickly, that it quite literally takes an army of crew to make this sort of thing happen. making sure things go off without a hitch for this sort of behemoth undertaking (*mind you, across dozens of cities a tour*) usually falls upon the shoulders of just a few key players (*with the obvious exception that each team is structured differently*):

* **Venue**
  * Promoter Rep - Coordinating with the tour to connect the technical staff (production manger, etc.) of the venue, as well as take care of accessory concerns   like marketing the show, arranging guest lists, organizing the 'front of house' (fan concourses), and in some cases hospitality, travel, catering and lodging for the tour.

  * Production Manager - advancing all technical details with tour management for the incoming show. this extends into setting up and coordinating local equipment rentals and staff (stagehands, riggers, accessory techs, etc.) as needed by the tour.

* **Tour**
  * Tour Manager — in some senses, the counter to the promoter rep. for the tour itself. responsible for making sure logistics don't get lost in the weeds, and that ultimately, the 'trains run on time' so to speak. also is typically the conduit for connecting production staff from the tour to the   venue / local team and facilitating that conversation. this is the party that usually accounts for all travel movements and lodging arrangements for a massive team.

  * Production Manager - oversee the actual core *technical* crew that is traveling with the production. this crew is who makes sure the stage is safe, the band sounds nice and crispy, and the visual / audio / lighting aspects of the show are all consistent from show to show.

**PHEW**
there are a ton of other key players on tours and at venues, but these represent the general *leaders* in making sure 
**shit.
gets.
done.**

the exchanges between these parties can cover everything from getting the bassist's sister's old roomate's niece on the guest list, to highly technical and sensative rigging and audio requirements, to legal parking permits from the city, back to the sort of infamous 'please pick out all of the *[insert color here]* M&Ms for our lead singer and leave them in the dressing room' rider requests you've probably heard tale of. 

now consider that some venues can easily reach 100+ show dates in under a year, and some tour managers can be on the road 10-11 months of the year with a rotating cast of artists.

basically — this is all to say that there are a lot plates being kept spinning all at once by these folks. the aim of **scout.** would be to automate and remove uncertainty from topics including:
 * correct rider (hospitality and tech) documentation for the most *current* tour. you would probably be sickened how often the wrong stuff is passed along in the booking process with agencies.
 * contact information and role for all respective parties on the tour and at the venue, so there is no confusion who is who, and additional parties can be included as requested on an artist's profile
 * tax documentation to ensure there is no stall in the settlement of shows
 * settlement receipt documentation
 * an easy scheduling and reminder interface for making sure advance calls don't fall through the cracks
 * other vital tour information such as lodging, catering status / menus, set-lists, prior and future tour dates etc. — in an ideal future there would be an intercactivity with programs such as MasterTour to enable a more consistent starting point and interface.


# future.
expand this platform to be more readily adaptable to events outside of music. 

take a typical game-day with the Chiefs, or most other professional sports franchises. depending on the scope of the game and themeatics, you can easily find yourself with a 50+ page game log and PA script made up of hundreds of calls to action ranging from pre-game to half-time to post-game. typically, every single one of these calls to action, or pieces of on-field production has: 

**1)** a staff touchpoint that is responsible for both its advance coordination
**2)** a production team member (or members) assigned to its execution
**3)** an individual or group of performers or honorees — often referred to at *'the talent'*
**4)** and an accompanying call for the announcer to make over the PA system

times that a few dozen, up to a hundred+ times, per game — for 10 home games a year.

adds up pretty quick right? and this isn't even getting into the operations of the stadium off the field (*think concessions, parking, ticketing, and a host of other focus areas*). a centralized, and tailored platform to assist in organizing these communications and automating certain game-to-game processes could easily save hundreds of hours a year for an internal production director.
